# MazeGen2
Reimplementation of one of my oldest hobby projects that I've made into an OpenGL toy

## Status

* FXAA needs to be implemented; glow needs to be more pronounced.

## Platform details
* __macOS:__ UI created with the Cocoa framework using Objective-C/C++. Use xCode project to build.
* __Windows:__ UI created with Winforms using C++/CLI. Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or later to build.
* __Linux:__ UI implemented in Qt 5 using C++ and xml forms. Use qmake to build. Built with Debian, but should
   work with any linux compatible with Qt.
  * ***NOTE:***: Qt's build system would probably work for macOS and Windows, but untested.
