# MazeGen2
Reimplementation of one of my oldest hobby projects that I'll eventually make into an OpenGL toy

## Status

* __macOS:__ Fully functioning Render and UI. OpenGL portion suffers from aliasing. Next step is to add FXAA. 99+% complete.
* __Windows:__ Same satus as __macOS:__, with UI implemented using winforms. 99+% complete.
* __Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):__ Skeleton of project in release. 5% complete.
